## URGENT: WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

You need to condense a dissertation literature review chapter into a publication-ready journal article for JELPS (Journal of Educational Leadership and Policy Studies). The work is 95% complete - just needs final condensation execution and Word document generation.

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Use the DISSERTATION as base** (`chapter2_literature_review.txt` - 13,280 words, 1,522 lines)
2. **Preserve 90-95% of dissertation's original writing** (user was explicit about this)
3. **Target word count:** 5,000-7,000 words (excluding references)
4. **Add 10-15 new 2024-2025 citations** from current research
5. **Maintain high academic quality:** 5-7 sentence paragraphs, minimal bold, smooth flow
6. **Generate three Word documents** with exact JELPS formatting

## EXACT CONDENSATION STRATEGY

**DO NOT REWRITE - USE DISSERTATION TEXT AS-IS (90-95% preservation)**

**Condensation Methods:**
1. **Remove entire subsections** (e.g., redundant examples, extended tangents)
2. **Consolidate examples** (keep 2-3 best examples instead of 4-5)
3. **Remove redundancy** (full definition in one section, brief reference elsewhere)
4. **Tighten language** (remove "very," "really," wordy phrases - precision language only)
5. **Strategic citation pruning** (keep most relevant, remove tangential)

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite existing paragraphs (preserve dissertation voice)
- Change sentence structure unnecessarily
- Remove key concepts or theoretical frameworks
- Create choppy 1-3 sentence paragraphs (maintain 5-7 sentences where possible)

---

## ACADEMIC QUALITY STANDARDS (MUST MAINTAIN)

**From `docs/ACADEMIC_LITERATURE_REVIEW_STANDARDS.md`:**

1. **Paragraph length:** 5-7 sentences optimal (minimum 4, maximum 8)
2. **Bold formatting:** Section headings ONLY (no body text bold)
3. **Citation integration:** Synthesize, don't list sequentially
4. **Transitions:** Smooth connections between paragraphs
5. **Professional academic tone** throughout

---

## WORD DOCUMENT GENERATION

**Use:** `create_jelps_manuscript.js` (VERIFIED WORKING - generated real .docx file)

**To run:**
```bash
node create_jelps_manuscript.js
```

**Script reads:** Input markdown file path (currently hardcoded to `JELPS_Manuscript_Academic_Quality.md`)

**YOU MUST UPDATE LINE 6** to read the new condensed manuscript:
```javascript
const manuscriptPath = 'C:\\Users\\MarieLexisDad\\repos\\literature-review-submission\\JELPS_Manuscript_Final_Condensed.md';
```

**Script generates:** `JELPS_Manuscript_Formatted.docx` with exact JELPS formatting

**JELPS Formatting (from script):**
- Font: 12pt Times New Roman (main text), 10pt (abstract)
- Spacing: Double-spaced (480 half-points), 1.15 abstract (276 half-points)
- Indent: TAB 0.5 inches for paragraphs
