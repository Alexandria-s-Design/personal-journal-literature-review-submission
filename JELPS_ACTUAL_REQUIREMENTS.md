## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION

**I recommend Option 1 (Minimal Submission)** because:
1. ✅ JELPS website doesn't explicitly require cover letter or title page
2. ✅ All author information can be in the email body
3. ✅ Simpler and faster
4. ✅ Meets all stated requirements

**However, Option 2 is also professional** and follows standard academic practice. Choose based on your preference.
